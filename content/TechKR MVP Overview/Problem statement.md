Nigeria faces a persistent challenge of high unemployment, particularly among its youthful, digitally native population. While the country boasts a vast pool of skilled individuals (in coding, design, administration, finance, etc.), these talents are frequently underutilized due to:

1. Lack of Access: Skilled individuals lack access to international job markets and modern application processes.
    
2. Price Mismatch: Nigerian talent ius often overlooked by foreign clients due to perception of high cost, or conversely, exploited by low rates on existing platforms.
    

This results in a significant economic and social friction point: skilled people cannot find the right jobs, and cost-conscious clients cannot find reliable, affordable talent.
